## ✨ About This Project

**Strands** is a personal conversational workspace built on top of modern AI models like Gemini. It introduces a unique threaded chat interface that allows users to branch off specific messages, creating deep, organized conversations — similar to Slack threads, but optimized for AI interaction.

- 🔁 Smart context queue management (user-controlled)
- 🧵 Threaded replies to any message
- 💬 Real-time chat interface with React + Express
- ☁️ Backend deployed on AWS EC2
- 🧠 Device-based persistence using localStorage (Web) and UIDevice (iOS)
- 🧪 Gemini model integration via API

### 📱 iOS Support (Coming Soon)

A native iOS app is in progress, using SwiftUI. It will include full parity with the web version and support for saving, threading, and context queue tuning — with a shared backend and isolated device logic for now.
